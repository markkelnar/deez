              <p>To Our Buddy Cory:</p>
              <p>Thank you for always being our scout in life and our lifeguard.  You have honored those positions well except the day you jumped off a commandeered boat and we learned you can’t swim well and the night you wanted to fight T.I. in Austin.  The life lessons we have learned by watching you are countless like the time on the porch that you told us how odometers work or the time you manned up and helped us drink Floore’s Country Store out of Robert Keen’s beer whilst watching Mr. Keen.  Then there was that one time you helped mule drugs to the cabin and kept it a secret from Lewis (until he read the first draft of this statement).  Oh, and the classic, but short-lived, Julio Bourbon drinking game that we could not get anyone else on board and it didn’t help that he only hit three bombs that year. 
              </p>
              <p>We all appreciate that we are friends 364 days a year.  That one specific Saturday in October has not ended the friendship yet as much as Mark, Matt, and I have tried with the early on shit talking. 
              </p>
              <p>We wanted to wish you a very Happy 50th Birthday.  </p>
